# NodeJS IRC Bot

This project creates a bot with attached http server. The bot and server connection code is loosely based off the https://github.com/ktiedt/NodeJS-IRC-Bot.

I plan to implement the following features: yaml configuration files, compatible with cloudfoundry, and a web interface that plugins can display information on (example staticly serve logs).

## Legal
All code for this project is free to use with no restrictions and no garantee of usefulness.

## Prerequisites

* NodeJS (tested under v0.6.5)
